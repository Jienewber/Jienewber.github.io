I asked you for this same question as well, and you both gave the same answer, no wonder you guys have more than 90% similarities, and you urged me to wear a dress otherwise you won't be there, okay, I did it and hopefully you liked it.

As told you before, I began to know this sport from Jung Yong Hwa, the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist CNBLUE. In 2011, when I saw him teach snowboarding for his virtually wedded wife in a TV show called We Got Married, I began dreaming that kind of thing can happen to me someday and felt like trying snowboarding one day. So that day on Cooper Mountain is like a dream come true. You never know how happy I was when I saw the girl with a green halmet came to find me and helped me figure out how to stop the board instead of falling to make a stop at the end of the day. ー( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ");
